# Maturity Model Specification

The goal of this specification is to define a standard exchange format for sharing values of maturity models.

## What is a maturity model

A maturity model is a structured approach that organizations use to assess their level of maturity in a particular area of interest, such as information technology, project management, or risk management. A maturity model typically consists of a set of stages or levels, with each level representing a progressively more advanced level of maturity.

Maturity models help organizations to take steps they need to take to improve their processes, practices, and capabilities to achieve their desired level of maturity.

Maturity models typically include a set of criteria or characteristics that define each level of maturity, along with guidelines or best practices that organizations can use to progress from one level to the next. The criteria may be based on industry standards, expert opinions, or research findings, and the model may be customized to the specific needs and goals of the organization.

Maturity models are often used as a tool for benchmarking, assessing progress over time, and identifying areas for improvement. They are used in a wide range of industries and disciplines, including software development, cybersecurity, project management, and quality assurance, among others.
    
## Concepts

- **Maturity Model** Consists in a set of indicators. For instance, a maturity model may measure how mature is an organization in terms of digital dexterity.

- **Indicator** is a property whose maturity is going to be evaluated. For instance, following the example of digital dexterity, an indicator may be the use of word processor advanced features within the organization.

- **Maturity Levels** represent the different maturity stages available in the maturity model. Typically maturity models use three levels or maturity: Low, Medium, High or Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. 

- **Indicator Maturity Level** For each indicator, it indicates what are the conditions or criteria required in order to achieve or comply with that level of maturity. For example, for the indicator "use of word processor advanced features", the maturity level 1 can be defined as "less than 33% of the users of the organization have ever used the automatic index in a word document".

- **Maturity Evaluation** Is the evaluation under a maturity model for a particular entity. For example, when the digital dexterity maturity model is used to evaluate an organization such as UNICEF.

- **Indicator Evaluation** Is the level or levels that are assigned in a particular entity for a particular indicator within an evaluation. For example, the evaluation of the indicator "user of word processor advanced features" within UNICEF is level 3.
